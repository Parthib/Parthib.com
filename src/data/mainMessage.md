That's me! I'm a recent graduate from Yale University '19 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Currently, I work at Amazon Web Services in Seattle.

I build this website using React - you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/Parthib/Parthib.com). I periodically update this website with new projects. You can learn more about what I do using the links above.

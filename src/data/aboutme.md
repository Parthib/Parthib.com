### Introduction
Hey I’m Parthib! I'm a recent graduate from Yale University ’19 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I currently live in Seattle, WA and work for Amazon Web Services as a software engineer for the core EC2 Spot service. Outside of work, I’m the kind of person who likes working on small projects, and I thought I would share some of what I do through this website. Visit my [projects](/projects) page for more!

### Hobbies
* Running. In the Hot Chocolate 5k in Seattle, I got 61st place out of nearly 7000 people with a 22:29 time.

* Basketball (I’m terrible at it, but ball is life)
* Ultimate Frisbee
* Football
* Videogames. Some of my favorites are Dota 2, Super Smash Bros, CSGO, and the Witcher 3.

### Some Interesting Facts
* I am a Bangladeshi-American who was born in Japan! Here’s a photo of me and my parents in 2002 near the Kyoto golden temple:

* My family calls me by my Japanese nickname “Taisho” which roughly translates to “admiral”
* I stuck metal into a power outlet when I was 4. A short circuit set my building on fire when I was 14. A transformer blew up outside my building and nearly started *another* a fire when I was 22. I still decided to pursue an Electrical Engineering degree.
* My favorite vegetable is the eggplant, but I am also allergic to them 😔
* There are videos of me speaking in Japanese that I can no longer understand because I've forgotten the language.
